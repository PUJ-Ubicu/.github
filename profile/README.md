We develop Ubicu, a respiratory incentive system whose objective is to recover lung capacity through a series of respiratory exercises.

## Our system

The Ubicu system has the following parts:

- A web application, which is used to set patient therapies and receive therapy data from our app to analyze and track patient progress through therapies.
- A mobile app, where patients can view and do their therapies, connect to the Ubicu portable device to start measuring, track their progress, and receive rewards to use in the app.
- A portable device, which is used to measure the airflow of the patient's inspiration and expiration, the device collects this data and sends it to our app.
